## 3t is 3d in the terminal
3t is a toy program that renders OBJs in the terminal on Linux and macOS. It
was heavily inspired by
[javidx9's YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih20l3pJoeU) series on
building a similar renderer, but for the Windows console.

3t is meant to be educational, so while it works on my machine, it is
brittle and it may not build on yours. I also deliberately chose to
ignore error handling. So, if you want to build it, or use the code
for your own purposes, you are on your own. :-)
