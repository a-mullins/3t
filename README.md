# 3t: 3d in the terminal
3t is a toy program that renders OBJs in the terminal on Linux and macOS. It
was heavily inspired by
[javidx9's YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih20l3pJoeU) series on
building a similar renderer, but for the Windows console. 3t is meant to be
educational, while it works on my machine, it is brittle, and it may or may not
build on yours. I also deliberately chose to ignore error handling. So, if you
want to build it, or use the code for your own purposes, you are on
your own. :-)
